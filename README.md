Also this is my first time with XAMPP and at this time i use localhost and i am going to manage to buy the domain.

*The color pallete i used is attractive for a kid-training center web page also if u want to contribute in a way please contact at thebaghel@gmail.com or osuzooco@gmail.com also in thebaghel in Discord (Please email and dont DM in Discord if you have G-mail.
